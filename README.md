# blog

- Login using Github
- Data stored in firebease database.
- Used XAMPP for development.
- Database has fileds for user groups, but right now when the user logs in all blogs (in other user groups are also shown)
- Did not add functionality for Read More link.

Design:

- The other link in the user home page is intended to show more details like user blog statistics like how may users read the blog, subscribe to user groups.
